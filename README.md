Supports two kinds of APIs

-   `Html5QrcodeScanner` — End-to-end scanner with UI, integrate with less than ten lines of code.
    
-   `Html5Qrcode` — Powerful set of APIs you can use to build your UI without worrying about camera setup, handling permissions, reading codes, etc.

> Support for scanning local files on the device is a new addition and helpful for the web browser which does not support inline web-camera access in smartphones. **Note:** This doesn't upload files to any server — everything is done locally.
